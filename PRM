An activity
Represents a single screen with a user interface just like window or frame of Java.Android activity is the subclass of ContextThemeWrapper class.

onCreate()
This is the first callback and called when the activity is first created.

onStart()
This callback is called when the activity becomes visible to the user.

onResume()
This is called when the user starts interacting with the application.

onPause()
The paused activity does not receive user input and cannot execute any code and called when the current activity is being paused and the previous activity is being resumed.

onStop()
This callback is called when the activity is no longer visible.

onDestroy()
This callback is called before the activity is destroyed by the system.

onRestart()
This callback is called when the activity restarts after stopping it.

A service is
A component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations without needing to interact with the user and it works even if application is destroyed. A service can essentially take two states.

Started
A service is started when an application component, such as an activity, starts it by calling startService(). Once started, a service can run in the background indefinitely, even if the component that started it is destroyed.

Bound
A service is bound when an application component binds to it by calling bindService(). A bound service offers a client-server interface that allows components to interact with the service, send requests, get results, and even do so across processes with interprocess communication (IPC).

onStartCommand()
The system calls this method when another component, such as an activity, requests that the service be started, by calling startService(). If you implement this method, it is your responsibility to stop the service when its work is done, by calling stopSelf() or stopService() methods.

onBind()
The system calls this method when another component wants to bind with the service by calling bindService(). If you implement this method, you must provide an interface that clients use to communicate with the service, by returning an IBinder object. You must always implement this method, but if you don't want to allow binding, then you should return null.

onUnbind()
The system calls this method when all clients have disconnected from a particular interface published by the service.

onRebind()
The system calls this method when new clients have connected to the service, after it had previously been notified that all had disconnected in its onUnbind(Intent).

onCreate()
The system calls this method when the service is first created using onStartCommand() or onBind(). This call is required to perform one-time set-up.

onDestroy()
The system calls this method when the service is no longer used and is being destroyed. Your service should implement this to clean up any resources such as threads, registered listeners, receivers, etc.

Application components are
the essential building blocks of an Android application. These components are loosely coupled by the application manifest file AndroidManifest.xml that describes each component of the application and how they interact.

Activities
They dictate the UI and handle the user interaction to the smart phone screen.

Services
They handle background processing associated with an application.

Broadcast Receivers
They handle communication between Android OS and applications.

Content Providers
They handle data and database management issues.

Activities represents
A single screen with a user interface, in-short it performs actions on the screen.

Services is
A component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations.

Broadcast Receivers simply respond to
Broadcast messages from other applications or from the system.

A broadcast receiver is
Implemented as a subclass of BroadcastReceiver class and each message is broadcaster as an Intent object.

A content provider component supplies
Data from one application to others on request.

Fragments
Represents a portion of user interface in an Activity.

Views
UI elements that are drawn on-screen including buttons, lists forms etc.

Layouts
View hierarchies that control screen format and appearance of the views.

Intents
Messages wiring components together.

Resources
External elements, such as strings, constants and drawable pictures.

Manifest
Configuration file for the application.

Android operating system is
A stack of software components which is roughly divided into five sections and four main layers.

Linux kernel
At the bottom of the layers in architecture diagram of Android operating system. This provides a level of abstraction between the device hardware and it contains all the essential hardware drivers like camera, keypad, display etc. Also, the kernel handles all the things that Linux is really good at such as networking and a vast array of device drivers, which take the pain out of interfacing to peripheral hardware.

Libraries
On top of Linux kernel there is a set of libraries including open-source Web browser engine WebKit, well known library libc, SQLite database which is a useful repository for storage and sharing of application data, libraries to play and record audio and video, SSL libraries responsible for Internet security etc.

Android Libraries
This category encompasses those Java-based libraries that are specific to Android development. Examples of libraries in this category include the application framework libraries in addition to those that facilitate user interface building, graphics drawing and database access.

android.app
Provides access to the application model and is the cornerstone of all Android applications.

android.content
Facilitates content access, publishing and messaging between applications and application components.

android.database
Used to access data published by content providers and includes SQLite database management classes.

android.opengl
A Java interface to the OpenGL ES 3D graphics rendering API.

android.os
Provides applications with access to standard operating system services including messages, system services and inter-process communication.

android.text
Used to render and manipulate text on a device display.

android.view
The fundamental building blocks of application user interfaces.

android.widget
A rich collection of pre-built user interface components such as buttons, labels, list views, layout managers, radio buttons etc.

android.webkit
A set of classes intended to allow web-browsing capabilities to be built into applications.

Android Runtime
This is the third section of the architecture and available on the second layer from the bottom. This section provides a key component called Dalvik Virtual Machine which is a kind of Java Virtual Machine specially designed and optimized for Android. It also provides a set of core libraries which enable Android application developers to write Android applications using standard Java programming language.

Application Framework
The layer of architecture diagram of Android OS provides many higher-level services to applications in the form of Java classes. Application developers are allowed to make use of these services in their applications.

Activity Manager
Controls all aspects of the application lifecycle and activity stack.

Content Providers
Allows applications to publish and share data with other applications.

Resource Manager
Provides access to non-code embedded resources such as strings, color settings and user interface layouts.

Notifications Manager
Allows applications to display alerts and notifications to the user.

View System
An extensible set of views used to create application user interfaces.

Applications
You will write your application to be installed on this layer only.

Java
This contains the .java source files for your project. By default, it includes an MainActivity.java source file having an activity class that runs when your app is launched using the app icon.

res/drawable-hdpi
This is a directory for drawable objects that are designed for high-density screens.

res/layout
This is a directory for files that define your app's user interface.

res/values
This is a directory for other various XML files that contain a collection of resources, such as strings and colours definitions.

AndroidManifest.xml
This is the manifest file which describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components.

Build.gradle
This is an auto generated file which contains compileSdkVersion, buildToolsVersion, applicationId, minSdkVersion, targetSdkVersion, versionCode and versionName

The Main Activity File
This is the actual application file which ultimately gets converted to a Dalvik executable and runs your application.

The Manifest File
Whatever component you develop as a part of your application, you must declare all its components in this file which resides at the root of the application project directory.

The Strings File
Is located in the res/values folder and it contains all the text that your application uses. This file is responsible for their textual content.

The Layout File
Available in res/layout directory, that is referenced by your application when building its interface.

anim/
XML files that define property animations. They are saved in res/anim/ folder and accessed from the R.anim class.

color/
XML files that define a state list of colors. They are saved in res/color/ and accessed from the R.color class.

drawable/
Image files like .png, .jpg, .gif or XML files that are compiled into bitmaps, state lists, shapes, animation drawable. They are saved in res/drawable/ and accessed from the R.drawable class.

layout/
XML files that define a user interface layout. They are saved in res/layout/ and accessed from the R.layout class.

menu/
XML files that define application menus, such as an Options Menu, Context Menu, or Sub Menu. They are saved in res/menu/ and accessed from the R.menu class.

raw/
Arbitrary files to save in their raw form. You need to call Resources.openRawResource() with the resource ID, which is R.raw.filename to open such raw files.

values/
XML files that contain simple values, such as strings, integers, and colors.

xml/
Arbitrary XML files that can be read at runtime by calling Resources.getXML(). You can save various configuration files here which will be used at run time.

<resources_name>-<config_qualifier>
drawable-hdpi , layout-ar

Accessing Resources in Code
When your Android application is compiled, a R class gets generated, which contains resource IDs for all the resources available in your res/ directory. You can use R class to access that resource using sub-directory and resource name or directly resource ID.
