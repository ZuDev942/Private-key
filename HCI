<theo key bản word:
Soaps are good to watch for observing non-verbal behavior as the actors often exaggerate their gestures and facial expressions to convey their emotions. It is easy to work out what kind of scene is happening from the actors' posture, body movements, gestures, and facial expressions. In contrast, actors on the radio use their voice a lot more, relying on intonation and sound effects to help convey emotions. When chatting online, people use emoticons and conventionally accepted abbreviations, e.g. LOL.>

44. What is a user-centered approach?

A. Early focus on users and tasks.
B. Empirical measurement.
C. Iterative design
D. All of above
<def
Early focus on users and tasks. This means first understanding who the users will be by directly studying their cognitive, behavioral, anthropomorphic, and attitudinal characteristics. This requires observing users doing their normal tasks, studying the nature of those tasks, and then involving users in the design process.

2. Empirical measurement. Early in development, the reactions and performance of intended users to printed scenarios, manuals, etc., is observed and measured. Later on, users interact with simulations and prototypes and their performance and reactions are observed, recorded, and analyzed.

3. Iterative design. When problems are found in user testing, they are fixed and then more tests and observations are carried out to see the effects of the fixes. This means that design and development is iterative, with cycles of design-test-measure-redesign being repeated as often as necessary>
